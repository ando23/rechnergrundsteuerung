A hobbyist operating system by me and for me.


## Current State

Don't bother. It barely runs and then does not do anything useful either.


## Goals
Lightweight OS with GUI.

Target is 32bit x86 because of some old hardware I want to keep using.

### Restrictions
No spoon. Also no fork.


## How to build

### Requirements
After the switch to C, you will need these tools:
* QEMU
* NASM

* Make

For Windows, you will need WSL aswell.


### Instructions
Install the tools in WSL or your favourite flavour of Unix and then
* make
* make run

There's better projects for that like Haiku, ReactOS, or Serenity.
