# SYS/A

A hobbyist operating system by me and for me.

## Current State

Don't bother. It barely runs and then does not do anything useful either.


## Goals
Lightweight OS with GUI.

Target is 32bit x86 because of some old hardware I want to keep using.

### Restrictions
No spoon. Also no fork.


## How to build

### Requirements
Future versions will probably require a cross-compiling gcc, but for now this will suffice:
* QEMU
* NASM


### Instructions
Edit the batch files make.bat and run.bat to set the paths to your local copies of nasm and qemu.
* run make.bat to compile
* run run.bat to start the system in QEMU


## How to contribute

At the moment, please no.

There's better projects for that like Haiku, ReactOS, or Serenity.


## FAQ

Nobody has asked any questions.


## Legalese

DO NOT USE IT.

DO NOT USE IT ON REAL HARDWARE.

JUST DON'T.
