# SYS/A

A hobbyist operating system by me and for me.


## Requirements
Future versions will probably require a cross-compiling gcc, but for now this will suffice:
* QEMU
* NASM

## How to build
Edit the batch files make.bat and run.bat to set the paths to your local copies of nasm and qemu.
* run make.bat to compile
* run run.bat to start the system in QEMU
